%Create a small world network.
%
%INPUTS:
%  N = # of nodes. Organized in a circle
%  c = In the starting regular network, each node has 2*c neighbors. So C
%  is how far it goes (right and left)
%  p = the probability to rewire each edge. (the prob of long range
%  connections)
%
%OUTPUTS:
%  A = the small world network.
