% INPUTS
%   REQUIRED
%   eeg: struct with fields:
%       data: raw data values (voltage)
%       samprate: should be 1000, or 1500
%       starttime: usually 0, or first increment (0.001 or 0.000667)
%       LFPts: not completely necessary but if so you will get your
%       bounding box... if its not there, we extrapolate from samprate and
%       starttime
%       descript: 'recorded at... filtered at...'
%   OPTIONAL:
%   minZ: min z value for calculating duration and start-end of ripple, in
%       z, usually 1 or 1.5 (sd above mean)
%   minPeakZ:  minimum peak intensity for it to be a ripple, usually 3-4 (sd
%       above mean)
%   smoothSpan: Width of sd of smoothing kernel, generally 3-6 msec, for
%       smoothing the envelope of our ripple power.

%% code base that inspired this function

from supplement of Coordinated Excitation and Inhibition of Prefrontal Ensembles
 during Awake Hippocampal Sharp-Wave Ripple Events

All analyses were performed using custom code written in Matlab (MathWorks, Inc.).
SWRs were detected using LFPs filtered in the 150-250 Hz range on multiple CA1
tetrodes as previously described (Karlsson and Frank, 2009). Increases in power in the
ripple band were detected using a 3 s.d. criterion. A speed criterion of < 4 cm/sec was
also applied to avoid any spurious detection of high frequency fast gamma episodes
which occur during running (Kemere et al., 2013). Further, we discarded all SWRs that
occurred within 1 sec of a previously detected SWR, ensuring unambiguous assignment
of PFC spikes with respect to SWR onset time. A total of 19,888 SWRs were recorded
over 53 days (mean ± sem = 381 ± 18 per day). The average duration of SWRs was
96.7 ± 1.2 ms (n = 19,888 SWRs), and the average SWR rate was 0.12 ± 0.01 Hz (n =
53 days of recording).


from tang 2017, hippocampal-prefrontal reactivation during learning is
stronger in awake as compared to sleep states
SWR detection and modulation. SWRs were detected as previously de-
scribed (Cheng and Frank, 2008; Jadhav et al., 2016). Briefly, LFPs from
multiple CA1 tetrodes were filtered into the ripple band (150�250 Hz) 
and the envelope of bandpassed LFPs was determined by Hilbert transform. 
SWRs were initially detected when the envelope exceeded a threshold 
(mean ? 3 SD) on at least one tetrode. Detection ofSWRs was performed only 
when the animals� head speed was ?4 cm/s. SWR events were then defined as 
times around the initially detected events during which the envelope exceeded 
the mean. The duration of a SWR event was defined as the difference between 
its onset and offset and the amplitude was defined in terms of exceeded SDs 
above the mean (SWR properties summarized in Fig. 4F). For sleep analysis, 
only SWRs that occurred in SWS periods were included. For SWR-triggered 
rasters, peri- stimulus time histograms (PSTHs), and spectral analysis, 
only SWRs separated from others by at least 500 ms were included
