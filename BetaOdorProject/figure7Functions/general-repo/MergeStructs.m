% function [mergedstruct] = MergeStructs(newstruct,oldstruct,mergemethod)
% this function merges two structs.  Basically it will either append the
% new struct onto the bottom of the old, or it will update all the fields
% in the old struct to become those in the new. The resulting struct will
% have the fields of the new struct.  To merge two structs completely, you
% can call this function twice, reversing the order fo the structs.
% old strcut can be an n element struct, but new has to be 1


% update makes a new struct where all fields are present, but overlapping
% fields take the data from the newstruct

% addoverlap just tacks onto the old struct a new row for the new struct,
% and it only takes the fields shared by both structs

% addOne just takes the old fields, adds a new row from the new struct, and
% leaves new fields not part of the old struct alone.  if the new struct
% doesnt hvae old fields, they remain blank

% addAll takes all fields from all structs and tacks on.  here you will get
% empty fields in the old and new structs if they dont ahve those fields.
