%FUNCTION [ratemap, rawratemap]= cell_SmoothPlacePlot(session, unit, varargin)
% This function creates a smoothed place plot of cell u.  There are two
% subplots, on top a trajectory overlaid with spike locations, and on
% bottom there is a heat plot showing the firing fields.  This can be
% combined with the 'epoch session' function if there are multiple epochs
% in the session.

% INPUTS;
% session is a session struct with a coords or edit_coords field
% unit is a struct of a cell: has to have a TS field with timestamps
% varargin is below, these are parameters to play with the plots.  the most
% salient are gaussdev (the standard deviation of the gaussian kernel) and
% the factor (the number of pixels per bin)
% the remaining variables are mostly constraints on data
%
% OUTPUTS
% This function will create a figure, with the handle g
% ratemap is a grid matrix where each cell is the firing rate at that pixel
% rawratemap is the ratemap with no smoothing

% notes;
% this smoothes after spikes are divided, like the hasselmo lab, unlike the
% mosers lab
% The gaussian kernel size can be as large as you want
% There is a variable at line
% this function requires the following functions:
